## Use case 1. Using content from the Media Suite to annotate AV content in ELAN
As a scholar using video/audio items for detailed close-reading and analysis, I need to play content from the Media Suite in ELAN, so I can annotate it using all ELAN functionalities which are not available in the CLARIAH Media Suite. 

Advanced functionality of ELAN which is not offered (and most likely won't be offered in the future) by the Media Suite includes:

- ELAN is a desktop version, which in some cases (e.g., high precision in segmenting, speed) scholars prefer to the Media Suite web-based application.
- ELAN makes it possible to perform detailed structural and advanced segmentation of audio-visual items using dependent tiers. This is mostly useful for: aesthetic analyses (films, television programs), and multimodal analyses (e.g., verbal and non-verbal analyses of oral history interviews) which require to define relations between tiers.
- A secondary reason (there are not yet examples of this from the users) is that ELAN includes more than 14 audio recognizers, which could be used by scholars for the detailed analysis of the audio signal (manual and semi-automatic, e.g., based on silence gaps).
