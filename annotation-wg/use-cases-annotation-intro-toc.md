# Background

The [CLARIAH Media Suite](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/) includes a component for manual video annotation. This component is developed by Jaap Blom and Marijn Koolen as part of the CLARIAH annotation client/server [see CLARIAH Annotation working group](https://clariah.github.io/scholarly-web-annotation/). AV annotation is an essential requirement for film, television, oral historians, and other scholars who use AV media in their research. Typical tasks in AV annotation are: manual or automatic selection of segments of interest (generally time-based, but also to parts of frames), adding tags/codes manually (or automatically) to those segments, adding comments, links, transcripts, and other user or automatic metadata. These tasks typically occur during the research phases of corpus creation (rapid annotations) and analysis phase (more in-depth annotation) (Melgar, Koolen, Huurdeman & Blom, 2017).

Because not all the possibilities for annotating AV media can/should be developed by the CLARIAH annotation tool, we seek to achieve interoperability with important tools. One of them is [ELAN](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/).

## Use cases for interoperabiility between the Media Suite annotation tool and ELAN

These use cases resulted from task analysis of different scholarly workflows (add link here to broad WP5 use cases). From that analysis, we selected two main use cases for interoperability:

- [Use case 1. Using content from the Media Suite to annotate AV content in ELAN]()
- [Use case 2. Importing annotations and media made with ELAN into the Media Suite]()
- [Use case 3. Transcription workflow]()
