## Use case 3. Transcription workflow

As a scholar using ELAN to work with transcriptions of my own video/audio items, I would like to import those transcripts (and my AV item) into the Media Suite, so I can use the interactive transcript web presentation.

This sub-use case is the same as use case 2, but only for transcripts. Transcripts (verbatim or not) can be considered annotations, or media objects in their own right. This scenario of use is expected to occur mostly with oral historians (as it was discussed at the CLARIN [Munich OH workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cqI4bnfPzWfG605J8IqXSya-Hhgd8RB854SMnboIj84/edit#slide=id.g429c75591d_0_0)). Transcripts can be either created manually in ELAN (using ELAN's transcription mode), or created externally and imported into ELAN (for example, if a transcript is generated automatically using the [OH portal]( https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/apps/oh-portal/ )). If a transcript doesn't have time spans, and scholars want to align it with the AV material, ELAN facilitates the alignment in a couple of ways.
Note: besides ELAN, at least one scholar working with audio interviews reported to use YouTube for aligning transcripts (Youtube supports automatic alignment).
