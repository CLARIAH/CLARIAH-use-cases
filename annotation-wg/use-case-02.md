## Use case 2. Importing annotations and media made with ELAN into the Media Suite

As a scholar using my own video/audio items for detailed close-reading and analysis with ELAN, I would like to be able to import my media and annotations to the Media Suite's personal collections, so I can benefit from the functionalities offered by the Media Suite and relate my content to other AV content available there.

This use case assumes that the user starts annotating her own AV materials in ELAN and has made some annotations already. For example: the user may have segmented a video into shots, and may have added his own classification/codes to those shots. The user may realize that she would also like to:

a) Show/display her annotations together with the AV material via the Web (e.g., during a presentation or lecture), give the possibility offered by the Media Suite's resource viewer, which shows the AV source along with annotations in a dedicated web page.

b) Benefit from combining the analysis of her own material with other material offered by the Media Suite (for example, television, radio, film, or oral history interviews offered by DANS, Eye, or Sound and Vision). Note: this use case is actually already supported via the exporting function offered by the Media Suite and ELAN, but for scholars with limited data skills, combining data from the exports produced by the two tools may be challenging.
